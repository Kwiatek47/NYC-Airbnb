# NYC-Airbnb

Data Science Project

This project explores the Airbnb market in New York City using real data from 2019. We analyze different aspects of Airbnb listings, such as prices, locations, room types, and last reviews. The project combines data from CSV, TSV, and Excel files.

## Project Structure

- `notebook.ipynb`: Main analysis and visualizations.
- `data/airbnb_price.csv`: Listing prices and locations.
- `data/airbnb_room_type.xlsx`: Room types for each listing.
- `data/airbnb_last_review.tsv`: Last review dates for listings.
- `table.csv`: Example table for data exploration.
- `nyc.jpg`: Image of New York City.

## Goals
